/* GAME PLAN 
Layout:
    - Manipulate Layers so it kind of looks like stacked papers.
    - Custom Pages for Different Projects (Own Business/Career/Hobby/School).
    - Nav Bar
    - How do most portfolio websites look? How can I make mine stand out?
    - Content
          - Games, Comic, Clip of Animatic, Background Design Project, Pieces I'm happy about showing off, story boards, character designs, concepts, thumbnailing.
